# Azure B2C Custom Policies 

The base policies begin with the default [SocialAndLocalAccountsWithMfa Starter Pack](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-b2c-custom-policy-starterpack/tree/main/SocialAndLocalAccountsWithMfa) with the Social configurations removed and are located in the base-phone-mfa-no-social folder.

Each subsequent folder contents build upon the base policies.
